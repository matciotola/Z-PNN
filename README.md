(included in this package) 

## Prerequisites
All the functions and scripts were tested on Windows and Ubuntu O.S., with these constraints:

- Python 3.9 
- PyTorch 1.8.1 or 1.10.0
-  Cuda 10.1 or 11.3 (For GPU acceleration).

the operation is not guaranteed with other configurations.

## Installation

- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
- Create a folder in which save the algorithm
- Download the algorithm and unzip it into the folder or, alternatively, from CLI:

```
git clone https://github.com/matciotola/Z-PNN
```

- Create the virtual environment with the `z_pnn_environment.yml`

```
conda env create -n z_pnn_env -f z_pnn_environment.yml
```

- Activate the Conda Environment

```
conda activate z_pnn_env
```

- Test it 

```
python main.py -i example/WV3_example.mat -o ./Output_Example -s WV3 -m Z-PNN --coregistration --show_results 
```


## Usage

### Before start
To test this algorithm it is needed to create a `.mat` file. It must contain:
- `I_MS_LR`: Original Multi-Spectral Stack in channel-last configuration (Dimensions: H x W x B);
- `I_PAN`: Original Panchromatic band, without the third dimension (Dimensions: H x W).

It is possible to convert the GeoTIff images into the required format with the scripts provided in [`tiff_mat_conversion.py`](https://github.com/matciotola/Z-PNN/blob/master/tiff_mat_conversion.py): 

```
python tiff_mat_conversion.py -m Tiff2Mat -ms /path/to/ms.tif -pan /path/to/pan.tif  -o path/to/file.mat
```

Please refer to `--help` for more details. 

### Testing
The easiest command to use the algorithm on full-resolution data:

```
python main.py -i path/to/file.mat -s sensor_name -m method
```
Several options are possible. Please refer to the parser help for more details:

```
python main.py -h
```
